// Simple rebase from master (from the feature branch)
git rebase master

//Aborting rebase when there is a conflict (we don't want to continue rebasing)
git rebase --abort

//If there is a conflict (we are in conflicting stage) we have to use merge tool
//we have to resolve all conflicts
git mergetool

//After resolving conflicts we add all files
git add your_fiename
//or
git add .

//To finish rebasing after conflict we use:
git rebase --continue


//Playing with remotes

//To updates the references and see the diference between local an remote we use fetch
// git fetch is non-destructive
git fetch origin master
//and then to see differences
git status

//To rebase from remote we do:
git pull --rebase origin master
